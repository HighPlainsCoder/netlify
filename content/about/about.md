This is a personal site for experimentation, for CR Ewert.  CR is a programmer in the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area.  We are not currently seeking employment, but that doesnt mean we wont entertain outreach.  We would be looking for a Staff Engineer or Architect placment, or something special.

This site is not all our output; most of what we do day in and day out is private for our current employer.  If you want to see something let us know.
