    <h2>This Motherfucking website</h2>
    <p>This site comes with columns. Columns let you use the
    whole page, without having lines of text too long for
    any human to comfortably read.</p>

    <p>This site has a touch of styling to it, because most
    browsers default to stark black on white, and thats too
    harsh, even for a programmer like me.  It costs almost
    nothing, and improves the reading experience.  If it
    was cheap enough, I could implement user choice in what
    color scheme they liked.</p>

    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>And now, a word about content.  This site, unlike
    the <a href="motherfuckingwebsite-com.html">original</a> (thats a copy),
    doesnt say "motherfucking" every few words, and assorted
    other obscenities.  I know they are a feature of the genre,
    but I lost my taste for that in 4th grade. Tarantino can
    sometimes make it fresh and amusing again, but mostly its
    noise that stretches out the content without adding value.</p>

    <h2>Mobile friendly</h2>
    <p>[still working on this] Mobile web sites, although
    ubiquitous, are often a special problem for a simple
    page of content.  Every day I find a site that displays
    on mobile browsers as if I had a magnifying glass handy.
    I dont know (yet) what will fix that, but it should be
    fixed by any site that pretends to care about it words.</p>
