    <div class="innie"><h2>This Motherfucking website</h2>
    <p>This site comes with flex. Flex layout let you use the
    whole page, like columns, but with a different sinsibility.
    Its not done yet. That is, Im not done yet working up 
    how to do this page in flex.</p>

    <p>This site has a touch of styling to it, because most
    browsers default to stark black on white, and thats too
    harsh, even for a programmer like me.  It costs almost
    nothing, and improves the reading experience.  If it
    was cheap enough, I could implement user choice in what
    color scheme they liked.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="innie"><h2>Content</h2>
    <p>And now, a word about content.  This site, unlike
    the <a href="motherfuckingwebsite-com.html">original</a> (thats a copy),
    doesnt say "motherfucking" every few words, and assorted
    other obscenities.  I know they are a feature of the genre,
    but I lost my taste for that in 4th grade. Tarantino can
    sometimes make it fresh and amusing again, but mostly its
    noise that stretches out the content without adding value.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="innie"><h2>Mobile friendly</h2>
    <p>[still working on this] Mobile web sites, although
    ubiquitous, are often a special problem for a simple
    page of content.  Every day I find a site that displays
    on mobile browsers as if I had a magnifying glass handy.
    I dont know (yet) what will fix that, but it should be
    fixed by any site that pretends to care about it words.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="innie"><h2>It has a list, too.</h2>
    <ol><li>I am using modern css and tag tech, cause I dont
    actually care if this renders on your 1998 Nodia phone.</li>
    <li>For all I know, it does, but I got burned once trying to
    make a modern web site render on some antique POS, because
    someone in QA thought it should.  And I never got a lick
    of support from my "manager" about it, or any other team
    in the whole enormous company. But I'm not bitter.</li>
    <li>I use flexbox in this version
    (<a href="mycolumnsmfwebsite.html">there is another</a>)
    because each of these sections doesnt connect that
    closely to the other.  This isnt a novel, where “Harry
    &mdash; yer a wizard.” flows inexorably from "Mr. and
    Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive,..."</li>
    <li>Instead, its more like a chinese menu, where the
    Mushroom Chicken lives near, but has nothing much to
    do with the Mongolian Beef</li>
    </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="innie"><h2>And, I dont abuse header levels</h2>
    <h3>My headers nest</h3>
    <p>This is like God, or maybe Tim Berners-Lee, intended.
    <h3>My headers are headline sized</h3>
    <p>They dont continue into the distance, like the open
    sentence of a Victorian novel.  Thats what the body is
    for.</p>
