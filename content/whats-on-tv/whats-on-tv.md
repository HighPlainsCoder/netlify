In the brave new world of too much media, and fragmented
all to hell, its hard to know whats on.  Can we aggregate
all the sundry sources, and make a comprehensive TV listing?

To include:

* Netflix
* Prime Video (free, included, and your library)
* HBO
* Crackle
* Hulu
* CBS All Access
* Acorn TV
* Apple TV (your library)
